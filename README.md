# 📺 Missing Trailer Downloader for Plex 🎬

I initially bought a [Plex Pass](https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/) because I wanted to have Trailers for my movies and TV Shows.<br/>
For a minority of titles, Plex doesn't seem to have trailers however. Especially lesser known and foreign titles.

This script will fill those gaps.

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 **Detects Missing Trailers**: Scans your Plex libraries for items that lack trailers. (either Plex Pass or local)
-  ▼ **Filters out specified Genres**: You may not want trailers for concerts or 3 minute shorts..
- ℹ️ **Informs**: Lists trailers missing, downloaded, failed, skipped, or if none are missing.
- 🎥 **Automatic Downloading**: Uses [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to fetch the best available trailer from Youtube.
- 📂 **Organized Storage**: Trailers are saved according to Plex guidelines for both Movies and TV Shows. 
- 🔄 **Refreshes Metadata**: Refreshes metadata of items with new trailer. (Necessary for Plex to 'detect' them)
- 📝 **Logging**: Keeps a log of your runs for each library.

## 🐋 Run with Docker

An official image is available on Docker Hub under the `netplexflix` account.

- Image: `netplexflix/missing-trailer-downloader-for-plex:latest`

By default, the container runs on a schedule using cron. Configure via environment variables and a persistent config volume.

### Quick Start
```sh
docker run -d \
  --name mtdp \
  -e TZ="Europe/London" \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e CRON_SCHEDULE="0 * * * *" \
  -v /path/to/your/config:/config \
  netplexflix/missing-trailer-downloader-for-plex:latest
```

- Mount `/config` to persist `config.yml` and logs. On first run, a default `config.yml` is created from `config.yml.example` if missing.
- `CRON_SCHEDULE` controls how often the job runs (default hourly: `0 * * * *`).
- Set `RUN_ON_START=true|false` to control an immediate run on container start (defaults to true).

See `docker-compose.yml` for a compose setup.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Copy the example file and edit your settings:
```sh
cp config/config.yml.example config/config.yml
```

Edit `config/config.yml` to set your Plex details and desired variables:

- **LAUNCH_METHOD:** 0 = Choose at runtime, 1 = Movies only, 2 = TV Shows only, 3 = Both (Default)
- **PLEX_URL:** Change if needed.
- **PLEX_TOKEN:** [How to find your Plex Token](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/).
- **MOVIE_LIBRARY_NAME:** The name of your Movie library in Plex (you can comma separate multiple libraries. eg: 'Movies, Movies4K')
- **TV_LIBRARY_NAME:** The name of your TV Show library in Plex (you can comma separate multiple libraries. eg: 'TV Shows, TV Shows 4K')
- **TV_GENRES_TO_SKIP:** Add or remove any genres to be skipped when checking your TV Shows
- **MOVIE_GENRES_TO_SKIP:** Add or remove any genres to be skipped when checking your Movies
- **CHECK_PLEX_PASS_TRAILERS:** Default: `true` will check for Plex Pass Trailers. If set to `false` it will download all trailers locally.
- **DOWNLOAD_TRAILERS:** `true` will download the missing trailers. `false` will simply list them.
- **PREFERRED_LANGUAGE:** Default: `original`. When set to another language (eg: `french` or `german`), yt-dlp will attempt to download a trailer in that language
- **SHOW_YT_DLP_PROGRESS:** Can be set to `true` for debugging.
- **MAP_PATH:** Default `false`. Set to `true` if you need PATH_MAPPINGS in case of NAS storage for example.
- **PATH_MAPPINGS:** Used to map paths: eg: If Plex looks for your movies in "/media/movies" and this directory is mapped on your computer as "P:/media/movies" you can map as followed: "/media": "P:/media"

## 🚀 Usage - Running the Script

Open a Terminal in your script directory and launch the script with:
```sh
python MTDP.py
```
You’ll be prompted to choose:
- **1**: Run Movie library.
- **2**: Run TV shows library.
- **3**: Scan both consecutively.

Alternatively, pre-set your preferred method in `config.yml` (`LAUNCH_METHOD` field) to bypass selection.

> [!TIP]
> Windows users can create a batch file to quickly launch the script.<br/>
> Type `"[path to your python.exe]" "[path to the script]" -r pause"` into a text editor
>
> For example:
> ```
>"C:\Users\User1\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe" "P:\Scripts\Missing Trailer Downloader for Plex\MTDP.py" -r
>pause
> ```
> Save as a .bat file. You can now double click this batch file to directly launch the script.<br/>
> You can also use this batch file to [schedule](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-automated-task-using-task-scheduler-windows-10) the script to run daily/weekly/etc.
